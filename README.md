# Cloud Service Models: IAAS, PAAS, SAAS

Cloud computing provides various service models to meet different business and technical needs. The three most common models are **IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service)**, **PAAS (Platform as a Service)**, and **SAAS (Software as a Service)**. Each offers different levels of control, flexibility, and management.

## 1. IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service)

**Definition:**
IAAS is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers fundamental infrastructure services such as virtual machines, storage, networking, and more.

**Key Features:**
- **Resource Flexibility**: Users can rent computing resources (like VMs) as needed.
- **Scalability**: Can scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Cost-effective**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- **Minimal Management**: The user manages the operating system, applications, and middleware, while the provider manages hardware infrastructure.

**Examples:**
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Compute Engine (GCE)

---

## 2. PAAS (Platform as a Service)

**Definition:**
PAAS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying hardware or software layers. It offers the environment and tools to support the entire application lifecycle.
